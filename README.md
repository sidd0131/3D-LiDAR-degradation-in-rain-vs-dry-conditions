# E026-DIP-LiDAR
Team project as a requirement for course module EE3180 Design and Innovation Project (DIP). We are performing LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E extracted data explorations to infer how drastically accuracy of object detection is affected in rainy versus dry conditions.

## Official Project Description Summarized:
Utilization of commercial LiDAR sensors and cameras to extract data on how rain affects sensor performance and detection capabilities, creating signal processing and deep learning algorithms to integrate real-time sensing to assess the impact of rain on various targets.
